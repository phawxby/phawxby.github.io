# About

Hawxby.com is the personal website of Herts based web developer Paul Hawxby. Iâ€™m an almost entirely self taught programmer starting out around the age of 13 with ASP Classic and Visual Basic 6. Thankfully things have moved on quite considerably since then, and so have I thanks to a constant drive to be at the leading edge of development trends and technology while harbouring strong adaptability to change.

I believe in clean, well structured code with a focus on standards, performance, interoperability and accessibility. I aim to instil these same beliefs in all those I work with for the betterment of the web in general, and the sanity of future developers maintaining the code.
